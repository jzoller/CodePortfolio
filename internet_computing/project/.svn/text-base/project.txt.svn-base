The Public Works Department wants you to build an application to manage
their rural area. Their workers will carry a mobile device as they drive
around the area. The area is rather remote and their internet connection
is spotty. The application must be usable to a reasonable extent even when 
they're disconnected.

The application has one page - create work order.

A work order has the following details:

1. Work description - Up to 300 words.
2. Work location (lat, lon, and altitude)
3. Date of creation
4. Person creating the work order (full name)
5. Severity (Minor, Major, Urgent)

When a user enters a data and clicks on save, the data is sent to the server
and the form is cleared.

If the device is not connected to the network, the data is stored locally on the
device. Next time the user comes back to the application or saves a new work order,
the stored data is transmitted to the server.

The above is the client side. For the server side, create a node.js application that
will receive the data from the client side and simply display it on the console.
