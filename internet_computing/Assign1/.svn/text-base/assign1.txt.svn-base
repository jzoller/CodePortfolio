First write a JavaScript program that will display the weather information for several cities.
The input will come from a file which contains a list of WOEIDs, one line at a time.
You can obtain the weather details from <http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?w=WOEID&u=f>.

The program should read the file, issue requests to the webservice, parse the result,
and display, in sorted by the name of the city (and state, if two cities have the same
name), the current temperature in the city.

Format of output:

City, State		Temperature
...		...			... 
...		...			... 
...		...			... 
...		...			... 
...		...			... 
...		...			... 
...		...			... 
...		...			... 
...		...			... 


For WOEIDs for different cities, please visit <http://weather.yahoo.com>. For example,
the WOEIDs for Houston, TX is 2424766.

When you're done with the program, keep the JavaScript version, but write a version of
the program using CoffeeScript.
