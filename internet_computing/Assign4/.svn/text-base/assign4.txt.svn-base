Create the game of battleship (a modified version) using Node.js. 

It is perfectly fine to create a command-line program, no GUI is required.

Features:
1. User connects to the server, provides a name.
2. User can view a list of players available.
3. Can initiate a game with a waiting player
4. Once the game starts, each user is expected to send locations of their five ships
	(we will assume each ship takes only one location on a 8x8 grid).
5. Each user takes turn to hit a target. The server keeps track of where the users hit.
6. The first player to sink all of the opponent's ship is declared a winner.
7. Once the game is over (won or lost), the user will have to reconnect and provide their name again.
